Notepad++ User Manual
=======

***Documentation is like sex, when it's good, it's very, very good; when it's bad, it's better than nothing.***

Of course, it's not our goal to create a bad documentation, but we are sure you've got the point to where we are heading.

**Notepad++ User Manual** is built collaboratively, and your contribution is very welcome. Before submitting a pull request (PR), please check our [contribution rules](CONTRIBUTION.md) to prevent your PR from being rejected.
