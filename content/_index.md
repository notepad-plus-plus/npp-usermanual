Notepad++ User Manual 
=======

***Documentation is like sex, when it's good, it's very, very good; when it's bad, it's better than nothing.***

Of course, it's not our goal to create bad documentation, but you get what we mean.

**Notepad++ User Manual** is built collaboratively, and [your contribution is very welcome](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/npp-usermanual).
