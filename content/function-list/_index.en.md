## What is Function List
Function List Panel is a zone to display all the functions (or method) found in the current file. The user can use the Function List Panel to access a function definition quickly by double clicking function item on the list. Function List can be customized to list the functions for whichever language. For customizing Function List to recognize your favorite language, please check below.


Function list contains a search engin (by using regular expression) and a panel to display the search result (function list). It is designed to be as generic as possible, and allows user to modify the way to search, or to add new parser for any programming language.
In order to make function list work for your language (if not supported), you should modify functionList.xml. It can be found in %APPDATA%\notepad++\ or in Notepad++ installed directory if you use zip package.
