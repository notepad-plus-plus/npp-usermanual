## Supported Programming Languages

Around 90 Programming Languages are supported by Notepad++:

For these languages, Notepad++ supports [syntax highlighting](../preferences/#style-configurator) (customizable),
syntax folding, [auto-completion](../auto-completion/) (customizable),
[function list](../function-list/) (customizable via PCRE in xml file).

If your beloved language is not in the list above, you can define it yourself easily, by using the
[User Defined Languages System](../user-defined-language-system/).  If that doesn't meet your needs,
you could write (or have someone else write) a [lexer plugin](../plugins/#building-a-lexer-plugin).

Please note that in Notepad++ v8.3 and newer, Notepad++ has a feature will no longer perform syntax highlighting
on files that are over 200MB -- this prevents extreme performance slowdown caused by trying to
syntax highlight extremely large files.  This threshold is configurable in
[Settings > Preferences > Performance](../preferences/#performance) (starting in v8.4.7).

### Notes on Specific Languages

#### JavaScript

Internally, there are actually two entries for JavaScript: in the [Style Configurator](../preferences/#style-configurator),
these show up as "JavaScript" and "JavaScript (embedded)".  The first is for
standalone JavaScript files (usually with `.js` extension); the second is for when JavaScript is embedded in an HTML
file -- so you can actually have different color rules for when the JavaScript is inside HTML and when it's a separate
file.  (In the [`langs.xml`](../config-files/#keyword-lists-langsxml) and [`stylers.xml`](../config-files/#highlighting-schemes-stylersxml)
config files, the standalone uses `name="javascript.js"`.)

If you manually pick **Language > J > JavaScript**, the active file will use the standalone JavaScript settings.

#### ErrorList

The ErrorList language, available starting in v8.8.1, is useful for looking at logfiles, error output from compilers,
and colorful terminal outputs (like from the Windows PowerShell window or a Linux shell window), or anything else which
uses [ANSI escape codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code). The syntax highlighting for this language will
 include coloring the various error outputs, as well as applying the _foreground_ color specified from ANSI escape codes
 (it will _not_ change the background color, even if the ANSI escape sequence does).

While this Language is active, if you toggle **[View > Show Symbol](../views/#show-symbol) > Show Control Characters &
Unicode EOL** (or **Show All Characters**, or use the [Toolbar](../user-interface/#toolbar) equivalents):
when control characters or all characters are
shown, then ANSI escape sequences will look like <kbd>ESC</kbd>`[31m`, and will take up space in the view; when control
character are not shown (or when **Show All Characters** is toggled off), then the entire escape sequence will be
hidden.  (This is different than in other lexers, where turning off the control character visibility would just hide the
 `ESC` character, but not the rest of the ANSI escape sequence.)

### Themes and Language Support

There are times when a particular Theme will not have been updated to include syntax highlighting for a given Language.
If a Language you need is missing in your chosen Theme, you can open `%AppData%\Notepad++\stylers.xml` (if you use the
default theme) or the appropriate `%AppData%\Notepad++\themes\______.xml` file for your Theme,
plus the `C:\Program Files\Notepad++\stylers.model.xml` (the locations of both those file can vary depending on your active
[Config Files Location](../config-files/#configuration-files-location) for `themes\______.xml`, and your `notepad++.exe` executable's
directory for the `stylers.model.xml`, if you are not using a default installation).  Search in `stylers.model.xml` for the
`<LexerType...>` section for the missing Language, and copy that over to the appropriate location in your `themes\______.xml`.
Close Notepad++ completely and re-run it: that Language should now be in the [Style Configurator](../preferences/#style-configurator)
for your active theme, though depending on how different your Theme's color scheme is compared to the Default Theme, the colors
may be jarring compared to your Theme's background color; but once it's in the Style Configurator, you may update the color scheme for
that Language in the Style Configurator. (If your Theme is a dark Theme, it might be better to copy from `themes\DarkModeDefault.xml`
instead of copying from `stylers.model.xml`.)

Similarly, the Style Configurator lists Default Keyword Lists for the styles of some languages: those are defined in `%AppData%\Notepad++\langs.xml`, and the defaults are in `C:\Program Files\Notepad++\langs.model.xml`.  If `langs.model.xml` has been updated, then you can copy the updated or added keyword lists from there into your `langs.xml`.

### Contribution: Enable Lexilla Lexer That Is Not Active In Notepad++

The [Lexilla library](https://github.com/ScintillaOrg/lexilla/) which Notepad++ uses for syntax highlighting has many languages available to it that Notepad++ doesn't yet provide in the **Language** menu and Style Configurator.  In general, just creating an [issue](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues) to request a language be enabled is not sufficient to get it added, because the developers don't have sufficient knowledge of all Lexilla-enabled languages to know if the addition was successful or not; you should put in the request if there's a language in Lexilla that you would like added to Notepad++, but, if possible, you could also put in the Pull Request.  (While it's not sufficient, creating the issue _is_ a [necessary first step](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), because the developer generally does not merge Pull Requests that aren't attached to an existing open issue.)

Creating a PR yourself to enable a not-yet-active lexer should only be attempted if you are familiar with the GitHub environment and the git system of version control, and are comfortable developing in C++.  If this is something that you are ready to do, the following are all pieces of the codebase that need to be updated in order to activate a currently-inactive lexer. For this description, "Xyz Pdq" will be the placeholder name of your language; you, of course, need to use your own language's name instead of the placeholder.

- `PowerEditor/src/MISC/PluginsManager/Notepad_plus_msgs.h`:
    - Need to add an `L_XYZPDQ` constant for your language to the end of the `enum LangType`
    - Insert it between the last real language in the list and `L_EXTERNAL`; **never** insert it before an already-existing language, as the position in the list gives it an integer that is used throughout the codebase and config files.
- `PowerEditor/src/menuCmdID.h`:
    - Add `#define IDM_LANG_XYZPDQ` between the last existing language and `IDM_LANG_EXTERNAL`, using the next integer for the value (the `L_XYZPDQ` from the enum should be in that same integer slot in the enum)
- `PowerEditor/src/ScintillaComponent/ScintillaEditView.h`
    - declare `setXyzPdqLexer()`
    - if it's a simple lexer, which just needs to define one or more keyword lists, you can define it here instead of in the `.cpp` below, just calling `setLexer(L_XYZPDQ, LIST_0 | LIST_1 | ...);`, similar to what was done for `setHollywoodLexer()`
    - An aside on the keyword lists: The `lexilla/Lexers/LexXyzPdq.cxx` will contain one or more `WordList` variables; usually in `LexerXyzPdq::WordListSet()`, you will see a mapping between the word list index and th `WordList` variable.  That index corresponds to the `LIST_#` constant used when calling `setLexer()`.
- `PowerEditor/src/ScintillaComponent/ScintillaEditView.cpp`
    - add the language to `LanguageNameInfo ScintillaEditView::_langNameInfoArray[]`, just before the `L_EXTERNAL` entry.  The table below describes that value that needs to go in each column of that data structure.

        | Column       | Example        | Description |
        |--------------|----------------|-------------|
        | `_langName`  | `xyzpdq`       | Unique string to identify the language.  Will be used as the `<Language name="xyzpdq" ... />` attribute in `langs.xml` |
        | `_shortName` | `Xyz Pdq`      | This is the text that appears in the **Languages** menu |
        | `_longName`  | `Xyz Pdq file` | This is the text that appears in the **Status Bar**'s file type field |
        | `_langID`    | `L_XYZPDQ`     | This is the `L_XYZPDQ` entry you added to the enum |
        | `_lexerID`   | `xyzpdq`       | This is the name of the lexer, as defined in the `lexilla/Lexers/LexXyzPdq.cxx`, in the `LexerModule` instantiation |

    - add your language to the big `switch` block in `ScintillaEditView::defineDocType()`; it should call `setXyzPdqLexer(); break`
    - add in the definition for your `setXyzPdqLexer()`
        - If it's just calling `setLexer()`, you can actually define it in the `.h`, as described above.
        - If it requires complicated logic, define it here, instead.
        - If the lexer includes SubStyle keyword capability, you can either initialize them in the optional end arguments of the `setLexer()` call (see `setLuaLexer()` and `setPythonLexer()` in the `.h` for examples of how to use those optional arguments), or your more-complicated definitions may call `populateSubStyleKeywords()` themselves, like `ScintillaEditView::setTypeScriptLexer()` does)
            - if you are unsure whether your language has substyles, just search the `lexilla/Lexers/LexXyzPdq.cxx` for the word `SubStyle`; with some digging in the code, you should be able to determine which Style the SubStyles get attached to, as well.
- `PowerEditor/src/Notepad_plus.cpp`:
    - in the switch in `Notepad_plus::menuID2LangType()`, add
        ```
        case IDM_LANG_XYZPDQ:
            return L_XYZPDQ;
        ```
- `PowerEditor/src/Parameters.cpp`:
    - in the switch in `NppParameters::langTypeToCommandID()`, add
        ```
        case L_XYZPDQ:
            id = IDM_LANG_XYZPDQ; break;
        ```
- `PowerEditor/src/Notepad_plus.rc`:
    - add a `MENUITEM` in the alphabetically correct place in both the `&Language` big-list, and the `&Language`/`POPUP "X"` per-letter version.
- `PowerEditor/src/NppCommands.cpp`:
    - `Notepad_plus::command()` has a huge switch; add `case IDM_LANG_XYZPDQ:` to the big list of similar `case IDM_LANG_...` entries

And add in config files:
- `PowerEditor/src/langs.model.xml`: add in your `<Language name="xyzpdq"...>` entry with its `<Keywords ...>` entries
    - the `name="instre1"` is the keyword list for `LIST_0`, `instre2` for `LIST_1`, and `type1`-`type7` are `LIST_2`-`LIST_8`; `substyle1`-`substyle8` are for the eight substyles that Notepad++ allows (if the lexer has enabled substyles, of course).
- `PowerEditor/src/stylers.model.xml` and all of the `PowerEditor/installer/themes/*.xml`: add in your `<LexerType name="xyzpdq"...>` with its `<WordsStyles>` entries
    - `lexilla/include/SciLexer.h` has `#define` for `#define SCI_XYZPDQ_* N` values; you will need to make sure you have a `<WordsStyle ... styleID="N" ...>` for each of those styles.

You should also include [autoCompletion](../auto-completion/) definition and [functionList](../function-list/) definition if you have them (they are optional, but highly recommended).  If you submit a functionList, please remember to also create the [unit tests](../function-list/#contribute-your-new-or-enhanced-parser-rule-to-the-notepad-codebase) required to accompany new functionList parsers.

Once you have thoroughly tested your code updates, and verified that it can properly syntax-highlight the newly-enabled language, then you can submit your PR to the [repository](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/) and link it to the issue that you had already created.

## Language Detection Priority

When opening an existing file, Notepad++ has an algorithm for trying to decide which language a given file is, with the following priorities:

1. A language defined at the [command line using `-l`](../command-prompt/) is applied.
2. If the file is in the active [session file](session/) (the automatic `session.xml` or a manually-controlled session), it will use the language stored in that session.
3. If the file extension is a "known extension" (whether it's from the [Style Configurator](../preferences/#style-configurator)'s default extension list [in `langs.xml` or `langs.model.xml`] or user-defined extension list [from `stylers.xml` or `themes\<ThemeName>.xml`] for a built-in language, or the [User Defined Language](../user-defined-language-system/)'s extension settings [from `userDefineLang.xml` or `userDefineLangs\<UDLName>.xml`]), Notepad++ will use that language.
4. If the filename matches one of a few specific names, Notepad++ knows what language they should be:

    filename | language
    ---|---
    `makefile` | Makefile
    `GNUMakefile` | Makefile
    `CMakeLists.txt` | CMake
    `SConstruct` | Python
    `SConscript` | Python
    `wscript` | Python
    `Rakefile` | Ruby
    `Vagrantfile` | Ruby
    `crontab` | Shell Script
5. If the first line in the file gives a known hint as to the file type, it will use that.  This includes "prolog lines" starting with `<?xml` or `<?php` or `<html` or `<!DOCTPE html` or `<?`, or linux-style "shebang" lines like `#!/usr/bin/bash` which are looking for `sh` or `python` or `perl` or `php` or `ruby` or `node` to define the correct language.
6. It will use the default language only if none of the other rules have matched[.](# "There was a bug through v8.4.6 that made the default language apply on files without extensions, even if the first-line rule had already matched")

As Notepad++ goes through that list in order, it will stop as soon as it finds a matching language for the file.  And after Notepad++ has made its detection, you can override what it chose by using the **Language** menu (and when a session gets saved, the language will remember whatever language is currently active for that file for next time, as described in priority 2).

If you do a **Save As** on a file, it will use that same sequence for deciding the language, based on the new name and file contents.

Newly-created documents will assume the default language until they are saved.
