## Tabs

The keyboard shortcuts described in this section are the default [**Settings > Shortcut Mapper**](../preferences/#shortcut-mapper) settings; if the Shortcut Mapper has been modified, the keystrokes may be different.

The ```MOUSEWHEEL``` commands described require that the mouse pointer be hovered over the Tab Bar.

If the description says it will "wrap", it means that if you try to go beyond the last tab, it will next go to the first tab; and if you try to go before the first tab, it will next go to the last tab.  If the descriptions says it does "not wrap", then trying to go beyond the last tab or before the first tab will just stay at the last or first tab without wrapping.

- The tab bar settings can be found at [**Settings > Preferences > General > Tab Bar**](../preferences/#general), including the options to **Hide** the tab bar or to **Lock** the tab bar (so that tabs will not be movable from the Tab Bar, though they can still be reordered using keyboard shortcuts or menus).

- If you click on a tab on the tab bar, that tab will become the active tab in the view.

- If you hover over a tab on the tab bar, there will be hover text:
    - It will show the full file path for a file from the filesystem.
    - If it's a new, unsaved tab, then the hover text will be the name of that tab (defaults to `new #`, depending on language, but you can rename unsaved tabs even without having saved it to a true filename, and the hover will show the same text as seen in the tab's title).  Starting in v8.7.1, the hover text will also show the date-and-time when the new tab was created.
    - Hovering over an inactive tab may reveal the hollow pin icon (see the "to pin a tab" description, below) or the close icon (see "to close a tab" description, below). 
    - If **[Settings > Preferences > General](../preferences/#general) > Tab Bar > ☐ Darken inactive tabs** is checked, hovering over an inactive tab will highlight that tab, as described in [User Interface > Tabs](../user-interface/#tabs).

- To switch between first and last tab, use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + ```MOUSEWHEEL``` on tabs. ```MOUSEWHEEL``` up will take to first tab while down will take to last tab.
  ![tabNavFirstLast](../images/tabNavFirstLast.gif)

- To switch and activate next/previous tab, there are multiple options:
  1. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + ```MOUSEWHEEL``` on tabs. ```MOUSEWHEEL``` up will take to previous tab while down will take next tab. This method will wrap around.
  2. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Page Up</kbd> for next tab and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Page Down</kbd> for previous tab. This method will wrap as well.
  3. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> for next tab and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> for previous tab. Using use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Tab</kbd> while MRU is enabled provides great user experience. To enable MRU you can follow `Settings->Preferences->MISC.->Document Switcher`, then checkmark both `Enable` and `Enable MRU Behavior`.
  ![tabNavNextPrev](../images/tabNavNextPrev.gif)

- To move tab from one position to other position:
  1. Use <kbd>Shift</kbd> + ```MOUSEWHEEL``` on tabs. ```MOUSEWHEEL``` up will move currently selected tab to previous position while down will move to next position. This will wrap.
      - If the Tab Bar is locked (using [**Tab Bar > Lock** preferences](../preferences/#general)), then <kbd>Shift</kbd> + ```MOUSEWHEEL``` will just activate the next or previous tab (without wrapping).
  2. Use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Page Up</kbd> for previous position and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>Page Down</kbd> for next position. This will not wrap.
      - This will move the tab order even if the Tab Bar is locked.
  ![tabNavMoveRtLft](../images/tabNavMoveRtLft.gif)

- If there are more tabs than are visible on the Tab Bar, you can scroll the Tab Bar, to be able to see more
  1. Use ```MOUSEWHELL``` to scroll: "up" will scroll so you can see earlier Tabs in the list, "down" will scroll so you can see later Tabs in the list.
  2. There will also be ⏴⏵ arrow buttons: ⏴ will scroll so you can see earlier Tabs in the list, ⏵ will scroll so you can see later Tabs in the list.  (For a normal horizontal Tab Bar, the arrow buttons will be on the right of the Tab Bar; for a vertical Tab Bar, they will be at the bottom of the Tab Bar.)

- To move a tab from one View to the other, you can use the techniques described in the [Editing > Dual View](../editing/#dual-view) section or [Views > Move / Clone](../views/#move-clone) section, including:
  1. Use the menus: **View > Move/Clone Current Document > Move to Other View**.
  2. Right Click on the tab's title and select **Move to Other View**.
  3. Drag the tab's title into the editing pane for that same tab and select **Move to Other View**.
  4. If the other View is already visible, drag the tab's title into the editing pane of the other View, and it will move.
  ![move2view](../images/move2view.gif)

- To clone a tab from one View into the other, you can use the techniques described in the [Editing > Clone Document](../editing/#dual-view) or [Views > Move / Clone](../views/#move-clone) section section, including:
  1. Use the menus: **View > Move/Clone Current Document > Clone to Other View**.
  2. Right Click on the tab's title and select **Clone to Other View**.
  3. Drag the tab's title into the editing pane for that same tab and select **Clone to Other View**.
  ![clonedDoc](../images/clonedDoc.gif)

- To create a new file tab using the tab bar:
  1. If there is empty area to the right of the last tab in the tab bar, double click there and a new tab will be created.
  ![tabNavNewDoubleClick](../images/tabNavNewDoubleClick.gif)

- To close a tab using the tab bar:
  1. If **[Settings > Preferences > General](../preferences/#general) > Tab Bar > ☐ Show close button on each tab** is checked, you can click the red ☒ on that tab to close that tab.
      - When set to show, the close button will always be visible on the active tab
      - When set to show, in v8.7.2 and newer, the close button will be invisible on inactive tabs, though if you hover over the inactive tab, its 
  2. If **[Settings > Preferences > General](../preferences/#general) > Tab Bar > ☐ Double click to close document** is checked, you can double-click the tab's title to close that tab.
  ![tabNavCloseXDblClick](../images/tabNavCloseXDblClick.gif)
  
- To pin a tab using the tab bar:
  1. Ensure **[Settings > Preferences > General](../preferences/#general) > Tab Bar > ☐ Enable pin tab feature** is checkmarked.
  2. The active tab (and any tabs you hover over) will have a hollow "pin" icon.  
  3. Clicking that icon will "pin" the tab, which will change the icon to a filled-in "pin", and will move the tab to the left side of the tab bar (before any unpinned tabs, but after any tabs that are already pinned).
  4. Pinned tabs will show the filled-in pin icon whether or not they are active.
  5. Clicking the filled-in pin icon will unpin the tab.

### Tab Bar Right Click Menu

When you right click on the title for a tab, you get a context menu for manipulating that tab.

- `Close`: Closes this file's tab.
- `Close Multiple Tabs >`:
  - `Close All But This`: Closes all files except this file.
  - `Close All to the Left`: Closes all files that are to the right of this file on the tab bar.

- `Apply Color to Tab >` (new to v8.4.6)
  - `Apply Color #`: Applies the indicated color to the highlight portion of the tab bar.  (Applying a different color will _change_ the color, not combine the colors together.  Each tab can only have one color.)
  - `Remove Color`: Removes the color of the tab, returning to the default color scheme.
  - Starting in v8.7, these colors can be user-defined using the [**Style Configurator > Global Styles > Tab color _n_** and **Tab color dark mode _n_**](../preferences/#global-styles) background color settings.

## Menu Bar

The menu bar of Notepad++ has a variety of menus, including **File** (for generic file operations like open and close), [**Edit**](../editing#edit-menu), [**Search**](../searching/), and [**View**](../views/), **Encoding** (which affects how the bytes of the file are interpreted as text -- whether ANSI or UTF-8 or similar), **Language** (for [syntax highlighting](../programming-languages/)), [**Settings**](../preferences/), **Tools** (with a couple of built-in utilities), [**Macro**](../macros/), [**Run**](../config-files/#userdefinedcommands) (for running external commands), [**Plugins**](../plugins/), and the **Window** menu (for accessing open files already open in Notepad++).

It also contains the **?** menu, which is a **Help**-style menu, including actions that list the [command line arguments](../command-prompt/); actions that take you to the Notepad++ [home page](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), the [project page](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus), this [user manual](/), and the [Community Forum](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org); actions for the updater and proxy; the **Debug Info** (which is critical information when asking for help at the Community Forum or when creating a feature request or bug report at the [project page](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues)) and **About**.

At the far right of the menu bar there are also icons `+` (to create a New file), `▼` (to choose from the open files), and `X` (which closes the active tab).  (Before v8.4.3, only the `X` existed in that area of the menu bar.  Starting in v8.4.5, these can be made hidden using [Settings > Preferences > General > Menu](../preferences/#general).)

## Toolbar

There is a toolbar which has icons for various common tasks, which each run a specific menu action.  If you hover your mouse over that icon, it will show its name.  The toolbar actions include:

- **New** ⇒ [**File > New**](../files/#file-menu): Creates a new file.
- **Open** ⇒ [**File > Open**](../files/#file-menu): Opens an existing file.
- **Save** ⇒ [**File > Save**](../files/#file-menu): Saves the active file.

- **Show All Characters** ⇒ [**View > Show Symbol > Show All Characters**](../views/#show-symbol): Toggle showing all special characters.
    - Starting in v8.6.9, there is a drop-down menu available from this toolbar icon.  Clicking the button will still toggle from showing all to showing none.  But if you click the drop-down instead (or right click anywhere on the icon), you will see the full [**View > Show Symbol**](../views/#show-symbol) submenu, from which you can manually select which special characters to show and which not to.
- **Show Indent Guide** ⇒ [**View > Show Symbol > Show All Characters**](../views/#show-symbol): Toggle dotted vertical line `⸽` showing tabstops.
- **Define Your Language** ⇒ [**Language > User Defined Language > Define Your Language**](..//user-defined-language-system/): Toggles dialog to define a User Defined Language ("UDL").

- **Save Current Recorded Macro...** ⇒ [**Macro > Save Current Recorded Macro...**](../macros/#save-a-recorded-macro): Saves a recorded macro to a named slot in the **Macro** menu.

Plugins can put additional buttons on the toolbar, to perform actions provided by those plugins.

The toolbar settings can be found at [**Settings > Preferences > General > Toolbar**](../preferences/#general), including the option to **Hide** the toolbar.  And you can customize the icons used for those buttons, as described in [Toolbar Icon Customization](config-files/#toolbar-icon-customization-toolbaricons-xml).

## Tools Menu

This menu contains commands related to running [cryptographic hash functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function) , including [MD5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5),
[SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1), and the SHA-256 and SHA-512 algorithms from [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2).  (SHA-1 and SHA-512 were added in v8.5.5.)  These are useful for comparing the hashes for downloaded files to officially-published hashes, and for generating those hashes for files that you are publishing.

For each function, there are 3 commands:

- **Generate** - You can enter text in the upper field, and it will give you the hash output in the other field.  You can copy those results to the Clipboard through the button.  You can optionally checkmark **☑ Treat each line as a separate string** to get N different hashes for N different strings at the same time, rather than a single hash that covers the entire input text.
- **Generate from Files** - Will calculate the hashes for one or more selected files.
- **Generate from Selection into Clipboard** - Will use the text that is currently selected, calculate the hash, and put the hash results in the Clipboard.

## Document Switcher

The Document Switcher feature (which can be enabled or disabled using the **[Settings > Preferences > MISC](../preferences/#misc) > Document Switcher** settings) can be used to quickly switch between all the open files.

When you hold the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key and then press and release the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, the Document Switcher appears as a popup with a yellow background, showing the current list of tabs (or a partial list, if there are too many tabs); the popup will remain until you release the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key.  One tab in the list will be shown in bold, indicating which tab will be made activate when all keys have been released.  With the Document Switcher on screen, repeated press and release of the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key will move the bold indicator downward on the screen, to the next tab name in the list.  When the desired tab is bold, release all keys to activate that tab.

The first tab to be shown in bold when you start the Document Switcher depends on the **[Settings > Preferences > MISC](../preferences/#misc) > Document Switcher > Enable MRU behavior** checkbox: When not checkmarked, the first tab name in bold will be the tab to the right of the currently-active tab (or the first tab in the tab bar, if the currently-active tab is the last in the tab bar; or the first tab in the other View, if the currently-active tab is the last in the active View); in this mode, the order of the tabs in the Document Switcher is the same as the order of the tabs in the tab bar, with the files from the active View above those from the alternate View when both Views are active.  When that setting is checkmarked, the first tab name in bold will be the tab that was active just before the current tab was activated (the "most recently used" tab); in this mode, the order of the tabs in the Document Switcher is the "most recently used" order, with the most recent at the top of the list, and the least recent at the bottom, with the tabs from both Views mixed together in usage order regardless of which View they are from.

When cycling through the tabs in the Document Switcher, if the bottom entry in the list is reached and you again press and release <kbd>Tab</kbd>, the bold indicator will move to the top of the list; or, if the list was too long to entirely be displayed, the <kbd>Tab</kbd> will scroll the Document Switcher, so the bold indicator will move to next entry down, and the entry that was previous at the top of the list will scroll out of the visible popup.

If you hold down <kbd>Shift</kbd> (while still holding the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key to keep you in Document Switcher mode), and then press and release the <kbd>Tab</kbd>, it will cause the bold indicator to move to the previous entry in the tab list, rather than the next.

The Document Switcher functionality can also be achieved using just the mouse (if you have a scroll wheel): Right-click in the editing area for a tab and hold the right mouse button, then begin scrolling the mouse wheel (in either direction) to display the Document Switcher popup; further scrolling of the scroll wheel will change which tab is shown in bold in the list. Releasing the right mouse button will cause the tab that is currently bold to be activated. An alternate way to activate a tab using the mouse, while the right mouse button is still held and the Document Switcher is displayed, is to left-click on one of the tab names from the list, which will immediately make that entry bold, activate the tab, and close the popup (even though you haven't let go of the right mouse button yet).

Some users have wondered about a "yellow flash" they have seen when using Notepad++: If you <kbd>Ctrl+Tab</kbd> and then promptly release _both_ keys, it will immediately switch to the tab that is first made bold and will leave Document Switcher mode (since you released the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> key).  Depending on how promptly you release, this may just briefly flash the yellow-background popup, not giving you a chance to read the popup's list of tabs.

## Scrolling in Panels

Many of the panels have the ability to scroll: the graphical scrollbars can be dragged for fine control of scrolling, or click in the "empty" area of the scrollbar to scroll a screenfull at a time.  (With some OS versions, the scrollbars may require that you move the mouse over the scrollbar area before the scrollbar is obvious.)

For most panels with scrolling ability, if the panel is active, then the <kbd>MOUSEWHEEL</kbd> can be used to scroll in the vertical direction (<kbd>MOUSEWHEEL Up</kbd> scrolls toward the beginning of the document, <kbd>MOUSEWHEEL Down</kbd> toward the end); or, if there is a horizontal scrollbar but no vertical scrollbar, it can scroll horizontally instead. (Most panels do not have an equivalent mouse control for scrolling horizontally; though if your mouse has a second scroll wheel, that might work, depending on how your mouse's driver works.)

For the editor [View(s)](../views/), the vertical scrollbar and <kbd>MOUSEWHEEL</kbd> scrolling are active when there are enough lines of text to occupy more than one screen (or even when fewer lines, if [**Settings > Preferences > Editing 1 > ☑ Enable scrolling beyond last line**](../preferences/#editing-1) is checkmarked).  The horizontal scrollbar is visible when [**View > Word wrap**](../views/#wrapping) is on and there is enough text on a line to go beyond the physical width of the View; if it's visible, then <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>MOUSEWHEEL Down</kbd> will horizontally scroll toward the end of the line, and <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>MOUSEWHEEL Up</kbd> will horizontally scroll toward the beginning of the line (and a mouse with a second wheel may also be able to scroll the editor View horizontally, depending on how your mouse's driver works).

## Status Bar

If you have not hidden the Status Bar using the **[Settings > Preferences > General](../preferences/#general) > Status Bar > ☑ Hide** checkbox, then the bottom of the Notepad++ window will contain a status bar.

If the Notepad++ window is wide enough, it will contain six sections, as seen in this screenshot:

![sb-full](../images/sb-full.png)

If the Notepad++ window is too narrow, the first section will be missing, as seen here:

![sb-narrow](../images/sb-narrow.png)

1. Document Type: shows what type of file is being edited.
    - It will be the full name of the Language shown as active in the **[Language](../programing-languages/)** menu.  For example, if **Language > XML** is active, the Document Type field will show `eXtensible Markup Language file`.
    - If the Language is a [UDL](../user-defined-language-system/), the name of the UDL will be prefixed by `User Defined language file -` to make it obvious that it's a UDL, not a built-in language.
    - This field will not be visible if the Notepad++ window is too narrow.
    - Double-clicking or right-clicking this field will bring up a copy of the **Language** menu.
2. Document Size: Shows the length of the file (in bytes, not characters, since in many encodings, some characters take more than one byte to encode) and the number of lines in the file.
    - Double-clicking this field will bring up the **[View > Summary](../views/#file-summary)** dialog.
3. Current Position of the [caret](#caret-and-cursor "typing/insertion cursor"):
    - `Ln : ℕ`: Indicates the [caret](#caret-and-cursor "typing/insertion cursor") is on Line `ℕ`. (Line 1 is the start of the document).
    - `Col : ℕ`: Indicates the [caret](#caret-and-cursor "typing/insertion cursor") is on Column `ℕ` of the current Line. (Column 1 indicates the caret is at the start of the line.)
    - `Pos : ℕ`: When there is no active selection, this sub-field indicates which byte of the file the [caret](#caret-and-cursor "typing/insertion cursor") is on.  (1 indicates the caret is before the first byte in the document.  In many encodings, some or all characters may take up multiple bytes; there is more discussion on bytes-vs-characters in the description of the [**Go to...**](../searching/#other-search-menu-commands) command.)
    - `Sel : ℕ | ℒ`: When there is an active [stream selection](../editing/#selection-modes--column-editor), `ℕ` shows how many characters (not bytes) are in the stream selection, and `ℒ` shows how many lines are included in the stream selection.
    - `Sel ℙ : ℕ | ℒ`: When there is an active [mutli-editing selection](../editing/#multi-editing), `ℙ` shows how many separate selection segments make up the multi-selection; `ℕ` shows how many characters (not bytes) are in the multi-selection (throughout all the segments); and `ℒ` shows how many lines are included in the multi-selection.
    - `Sel : ℒxℕ -> ℙ`: When there is an active [column-mode selection](../editing/#selection-modes--column-editor), `ℒ` shows the number of lines in the column-mode selection (the height of the rectangle), `ℕ` shows the number of characters across (the width of the rectangle), and `ℙ` shows the total number of characters in the column-mode selection.
    - Double-clicking this field will bring up the [**Search** menu's **Go to...** dialog](../searching/#other-search-menu-commands).
    - _Note: The `ℕ`, `ℒ`, and `ℙ` in these descriptions are placeholders for numbers, not meant to indicate the literal value seen.  For example, it doesn't literally say `Ln : ℕ` -- it will say `Ln : 5` if it's on line 5, or `Ln : 7` if it's on line 7._
4. End-of-File Format: Shows whether the active document is using `Windows (CR LF)` line endings (`\r\n`), `Unix (LF)` line endings (`\n`), or `Mac (CR)` line endings (`\r`, for ancient pre-OSX Mac-format files).
    - Double-clicking or right-clicking this field will bring up the [**Edit** menu's](../editing/#edit-menu) **EOL Conversion** sub-menu.
5. File Encoding: Shows the file encoding or character set.
    - Double-clicking or right-clicking this field will bring up the [**Encoding** menu](../preferences/#encoding-menu).
6. Typing Mode: Shows which [typing mode](../editing/#typing-mode) is active -- insert (`INS`) or overwrite (`OVR`).
    - Left-Clicking this field will toggle the value.

## System Tray

When the [Settings > Preferences > MISC](../preferences/#misc) are set to **Minimize to system tray**, then when you minimize Notepad++, the main Notepad++ window will be closed, and the Notepad++ icon will move from the Windows taskbar to the Windows system tray.  If those settings have **Close to system tray** (available starting in v8.7.1), then when you close Notepad++, it will move to the system tray.  You can also launch Notepad++ directly to the system tray using the [`-systemtray` command-line argument](../command-prompt/).

When on the system tray, Notepad++ will not show up in the Windows <kbd>Alt+Tab</kbd> list of applications to switch between, nor will it show up in the main Task Manager's main Applications list; however, it will still show up tine Task Manager's Details list, which shows all the executable files running.

If you left-click on the Notepad++ system tray icon, it will activate the Notepad++ application: the main Notepad++ window will be shown again, and the icon will move from the system tray back to the taskbar.

If you right-click on the Notepad++ system tray icon, it will show a context menu:
- `Activate`: Shows main Notepad++ window.
- `New`: Shows main Notepad++ with a new file tab created.
- `New and Paste`: Shows main Notepad++ with a new file tab created, and it will paste the current contents of the clipboard into that new tab.
- `Open...`: Shows main Notepad++ window, and immediately calls **File > Open** so that you can open a file right away.
- `Find in Files`: Shows the **Find in Files** dialog, and allows you to run a search and/or replace action _without_ showing the main Notepad++ window.
	- If you run a search, the Search Results window or panel would be populated:
		- If the Search Results had been previously docked as a panel in Notepad++ (the default state for Search Results), then the next time you activate Notepad++, the Search Results panel will be visible with the results you obtained.
		- If the Search Results had been previously undocked and in a separate window from Notepad++, then the undocked Search Results window will usually become visible at this point, even though the main Notepad++ window is not visible.  You can use the normal Search Results navigation: so double-clicking on a result will activate Notepad++, showing the result you chose in the active Notepad++ view.
	- If you ran a replace action, those replacements will have occurred, even though the Notepad++ window is not visible and no results are shown.
- `Close Tray Icon`: Completely closes/exits Notepad++, and icon will be removed from the System Tray
