## Notepad Replacement

Notepad is a default text editor shipped with Windows. You may want to use Notepad++ instead of Notepad. However, there's no obvious way to do it: You can run commands to edit the registry following command to make Notepad++ replace Notepad (run in `cmd.exe` with Administrator privileges)[†](#registry-edit-warning).

For Windows 7 - Windows 10, use the following command:

```batch
reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v "Debugger" /t REG_SZ /d "\"%ProgramFiles%\Notepad++\notepad++.exe\" -notepadStyleCmdline -z" /f
```

Note that you may need to use `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Notepad++\` to substitute for `%ProgramFiles%\Notepad++\` if you have Notepad++ 32-bit installed, or use other path if your Notepad++ is installed in a non-default location.

For Windows 11 onward: first uninstall Notepad (just right-click on the Notepad shortcut in **Start Menu** and select **Uninstall**), and then run the commands below:

```batch
reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe\0" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d "\"%ProgramFiles%\Notepad++\notepad++.exe\" -notepadStyleCmdline -z" /f

reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe\1" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d "\"%ProgramFiles%\Notepad++\notepad++.exe\" -notepadStyleCmdline -z" /f

reg add "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe\2" /v Debugger /t REG_SZ /d "\"%ProgramFiles%\Notepad++\notepad++.exe\" -notepadStyleCmdline -z" /f

reg delete HKCR\Applications\notepad.exe /v NoOpenWith /f
```

**Note**: Windows 11 introduced UWP version of Notepad that use the same technique as described (but with undocumented [UseFilter](https://www.geoffchappell.com/studies/windows/win32/ntdll/api/rtl/rtlexec/openimagefileoptionskey.htm)) to replace the built-in Notepad. As UWP apps are started differently than regular apps, they cannot be replaced the same way and UWP Notepad must be uninstalled. Otherwise it would start when opening text files or when run from **Start Menu**. What\`s more, to be able to again use built-in Notepad (now redirected to Notepad++) to open text files the `NoOpenWith` registry value must be removed (based on [How to Restore Old Classic Notepad in Windows 11](https://www.winhelponline.com/blog/restore-old-classic-notepad-windows/)).

### Undo the replacement

For Windows 7 - Windows 10, use the the following command to undo the replacement:

```batch
reg delete "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe" /v Debugger /f
```

For Windows 11 onward: reinstall Notepad (launch **Microsoft Store** via **Start Menu**, search "Windows Notepad", select it and then click on **Install** button) and then run the commands below:

```batch
reg delete "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe\0" /v Debugger /f
reg delete "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe\1" /v Debugger /f
reg delete "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe\2" /v Debugger /f
reg add HKCR\Applications\notepad.exe /v NoOpenWith /t REG_SZ /f
```

  - `Copy Current Dir. Path`: Copies the file's directory (drive and directory, but not the  filename) to the Windows Clipboard
- `Move Document >`
  - `Move to Other View`: Moves the tab from one view to the other
  - `Clone to Other View`: Makes a tab for the same file in the other view

  - `Remove Color`: Removes the color of the tab, returning to the default color scheme

### Menu Bar

The menu bar of Notepad++ has a variety of menus, including **File** (for generic file operations like open and close), [**Edit**](../editing#edit-menu), [**Search**](../searching/), and [**View**](../views/), **Encoding** (which affects how the bytes of the file are interpreted as text -- whether ANSI or UTF-8 or similar), **Language** (for [syntax highlighting](../programming-languages/)), [**Settings**](../preferences/), **Tools** (with a couple of built-in utilities), [**Macro**](../macros/), [**Run**](../config-files/#userdefinedcommands) (for running external commands), [**Plugins**](../plugins/), and the **Window** menu (for accessing open files already open in Notepad++).

It also contains the **?** menu, which is a **Help**-style menu, including actions that list the [command line arguments](../command-prompt/); actions that take you to the Notepad++ [home page](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), the [project page](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus), this [user manual](/), and the [Community Forum](https://community.notepad-plus-plus.org); actions for the updater and proxy; the **Debug Info** (which is critical information when asking for help at the Community Forum or when creating a feature request or bug report at the [project page](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus/issues)) and **About**.

At the far right of the menu bar there are also icons `+` (to create a New file), `▼` (to choose from the open files), and `X` (which closes the active tab).  (Before v8.4.3, only the `X` existed in that area of the menu bar.  Starting in v8.4.5, these can be made hidden using [Settings > Preferences > General > Menu](../preferences/#general).)

### Toolbar

There is a toolbar which has icons for various common tasks.  The toolbar settings can be found at [**Settings > Preferences > General > Toolbar**](../preferences/#general), including the option to **Hide** the toolbar.  If you do not understand the icon, hovering over that icon will show the underlying action.
