Sessions are a set of files opened in Notepad++. They store the open files, the active file (and which view, see the section about Multi-View), the current selection and position in the file, the current bookmarks (see Bookmarks) and the current language (see the section about Languages). Using sessions, you can open a set of (related) files with one action.
