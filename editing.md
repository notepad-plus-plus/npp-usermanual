Primarily editing files is done by simply using the keyboard (or the standard Input Method Editor (IME) for eastern asian language) to change the contents, inserting and deleting text as needed. 

However, Notepad++ has many tools and aids to assist in editing files, mainly to automate repetitive tasks or speed up development.

Notepad++ is based on the Scintilla edit control and relies on it to perform many editing tasks, supplementing it if useful.
